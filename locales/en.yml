          text1: "Software development is complicated and expensive. The whole concept of modularity of the Engine is backed by real need to cut down development costs."
          text2: "We achieve this by re-using existing components as much as we can. They are designed with this idea in mind, so it’s more like “solving a puzzle” than “hacking”."
